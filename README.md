# A Web App That uses GitHub API to fetch My GitHub Repositories Portfolio

This project was created with ReactJs and Vanilla CSS

## Available Scripts

The first page has a list of all my Github Repositories with Pagination enable. A Search and Filter feature is also to be Implemented but am not yet done with that.

When you click on a repo on the first page it wiill take you to anotherpage showing data for that single repo when page. (Yet to be Implemented)

This project also has an an Error Boundary (i.e a page to test the error boundary whivh is yet to be implemented).
also a 404 page (a page to test the 404 page).

Finally this project is supposed to have a button that can be used to Create a new repo using a Modal, allow a way to update some details of the created repo, and finally add a way to delete the repo. (yet to be Implemented)
